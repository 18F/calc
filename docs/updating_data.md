## Updating contract data (out of date)

**NOTE:** This document is out-of-date and pending [review/removal](https://github.com/18F/calc/issues/840).

### About the data
[contracts/docs](../contracts/docs) has all versions of the data that has been imported to date. [contracts/docs/hourly_prices.csv](../contracts/docs/hourly_prices.csv) is the most recent data set.

The files that we get are in .xlsx format. They need to be converted to CSV. The columns should be arranged as such:
- Labor Category

- Year 2 rate
- Year 3 rate
- Year 4 rate
- Year 5 rate
- Education level
- Minimum years of experience
- Business Size
- Location
- Company Name
- Contract number
- Schedule
- SIN number
- Current contract year
- Contract begin date
- Contract end date

### Schedule 70 data

Schedule 70 contracts have a slightly different data format and are imported through a separate process.

[contracts/docs/s70](../contracts/docs/s70) has all versions of Schedule 70 data that have been imported to date.

[contracts/docs/s70/s70_data.csv](../contracts/docs/s70/s70_data.csv) is the most recent data.

The files that we get are also in .xlsx format. They need to be converted to CSV. It uses the same columns as above, but in a slightly different order:

- SIN number
- Labor Category
- Education level
- Minimum years of experience
- Unit of issue (currently ignored)
- Base rate
- Contract number
- Company Name
- Business size
- Schedule (always "IT Schedule 70")
- Location
- Current contract year
- Contract begin date
- Contract end date

### Updating the contract data

Save a copy of the CSV as the next version of the data in [contracts/docs](../contracts/docs). Overwrite `hourly_prices.csv` with the new file.

Run `./manage.py load_data`.

This will replace all existing records with the ones in the CSV.

Save a copy of the Schedule 70 CSV as the next version of the data in [contracts/docs/s70/s70_data.csv](../contracts/docs/s70/s70_data.csv), overwriting the old file.

Run `./manage.py load_s70`.

This will replace all existing Schedule 70 records with the ones in the CSV.

For more information on the Schedule 70 data loader and its configuration options, run `./manage.py load_s70 --help`.

Should the format of the file we import ever change, run `./manage.py makemigrations` and alert the team that they will need to run migrations on their local environments.

### Updating data on Cloud Foundry

Before pushing to an app, edit the `manifest.yml` and under the environment you want to push to, add `command: bash cf.sh`.
