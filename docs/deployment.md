This is to explain the deployment process followed in calc. CircleCI is integrated with the github codebase and triggers a deployment in cloud.gov anytime a file is changed. Cloud.gov is a infrastructure manangement platform that uses cloud foundry to orchestrate underlying resources that run on AWS. so Git commit -> git push -> branch merge with develop -> CircleCI -> cloud foundry -> AWS.
