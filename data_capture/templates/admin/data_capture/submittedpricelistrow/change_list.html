  The following rows are <em>only</em> for unapproved price lists that
  haven't yet made their way into CALC.
</p>
<p>
  For rows that are somehow out-of-the-ordinary, you can click the
  <strong>Is muted</strong> checkbox to prevent it from being included in
  CALC's data once you approve the price list.
</p>
<p>
  Remember to click the <strong>Save</strong> button to submit your
  changes.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've muted any necessary rows, you can visit the
  <a href="{% url 'admin:data_capture_submittedpricelist_changelist' %}">Submitted price list</a> admin page to approve the data
  for inclusion into CALC.
