Account for inflation: put these prices in current year prices.  We are not accounting for this now.

Account for changes in wages: Rate of increase of salaries across the country over time - longer term version of the analysis

I want to capture the volume of contracts negotiated in 2016 and beyond versus before.  So that we can have a sense of the forces involved with bringing down the variance of labor contracts.  

We want to look at variance in the context of magnitude of the prices. - So we want a discount factor for variance?
