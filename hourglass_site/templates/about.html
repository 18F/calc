<h4>What does CALC do?</h4>
<p>The CALC (Contract Awarded Labor Category) tool searches awarded hourly rate prices on the eight GSA professional services schedules and returns comparable labor categories and prices based on search criteria and filters used. Learn more about the schedules <a href="#schedules">below</a>, or on the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100611">GSA website.</a></p>

<h4>How can CALC help me?</h4>
<p>The CALC  tool was built to assist contracting officers and contracting specialists with market research and price analysis for labor categories on Federal Government contracts.  By capturing award prices in a database with an easy to use interface, we can enable a search to be completed in a couple of seconds and return up to hundreds of comparables, versus spending hours searching paper files or GSA Advantage to come up with only a handful of comparables.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the tool creates the opportunity to conduct calculations that will allow the contracting officer to gain understanding about the total population of data, such as ranges (highest and lowest prices), average prices. This data is helpful for negotiations for prices on contracts.</p>


<h4>Where do the prices in this tool come from?</h4>
<p>This tool shows actual ceiling prices awarded to various vendors at the master contract level, on the eight GSA professional services schedules listed <a href="#schedules">below.</a>  These are not prices paid at the task order level, which may be slightly different (e.g. to reflect a discount).
<br /> <br />
<b>Rates you see in CALC are:</b>
<ul id="about">
<li>Fully burdened hourly rates </li>
<li>Ceiling prices (awarded at the master contract level)</li>
<li>For the current fiscal year</li>
<li>Worldwide awarded rates</li>
</ul>

 </p>

<h4>Where does the data come from?</h4>
<p>The labor category prices are the awarded labor categories and prices on the companies GSA Schedule. It is the same data that is uploaded into GSA Advantage; however it is loaded on the day of award versus up to six months later (FSS-600) after award.
 </p>
 <p>
 The contracting officer uploads the data to the pricing tool after the price list is reviewed, approved and the contract award is made.
</p>
<h4>Where does the data reside?</h4>
<p>The source data is housed in a database on GSA Region 10 servers, and within Amazon Web Services account for GSA 18F.</p>
