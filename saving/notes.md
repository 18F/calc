Whats the goal?

To show value to product owner?
To managers?
To contract officers?

Who is the work flow providing value to and is it potentially multiple actors?

Managers -

Capture at the individual CO level - then role up to managers.  Which implies the amount of data about the broader contracting process is the same?

We have to know - capture at the indivudal.

How much of each labor category is being purchased?
How do we know what percentage of the money, flowing through those contracts is using calc to do its price analysis?

Metric - what is the adoption rate?  Adoption rate

Internval vs external adoption

External - adoption
External - tracked searches
Internal observation - capture information inside of calc

Distribution as well as number of hours they expect the contract to take

Percentage savings compared to others

Data capture opportunity - as people upload different prices we can capture those different prices.

Starting with an approximate - intelligent about the starting hours.  Therefore we are starting with an intelligent guess.  

Ask the question to COs for each labor category to start.

Track searches - how much time people are looking for "x" implies how much time people are thinking about schedule y and therefore forecasting out where we are allocating resources of the next time period.

"A quarter in review"

Internal observation is first
Tracked searches is second
adoption is third
