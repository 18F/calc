# This file can be used to add any temporary extra Python packages
# for experimentation or use by work-in-progress pull requests. It's
# particularly useful for folks using Docker, as it means that
# changing dependencies around a bit doesn't require re-fetching
# and re-downloading all of them.
#
# While this file may be populated during a WIP PR, though, its contents
# should be moved into requirements.txt or requirements-dev.txt before
# the PR is merged. In other words, this file should always be empty
# in the master/develop branches.

# TODO: Move these before merging this branch into develop!
